# DEA peristaltic pump

## Data overview
### This folder contains the data and matlab script for figures reported in the paper entitiled 'A compact dielectric-elastomer-actuator-based soft peristaltic pump for power and control of fluidic robots'
### The data includes 7 folders: DEA characterization, Comsol model, DEA-tracked videos, Pump chatacterization, Pumping of various liquids, Haptic actuator demo, and Finger actuator demo. The content of each folder is decribed below. Each folder contains the measured data, matlab scripts to plot the figures, and saved matlab figures. 
### DEA characterization: inludes data of DEA displacement chanracterization, blocked force characterization, and power consumption characterization. These data correspond to Figure 2, Figure S4, and Figure S5.
### Comsol model: inludes pump performance as a function DEA separation distance, phase shift, number of actuators, and liquid viscosity. These data are directly exported from the Comsol model. These data correspond to Figure 3, and Figure S7 in the manuscript.
### DEA tracking videos: inludes data of tracked DEA displacement from a video captured by a high speed camera. These data correspond to Figure 2.
### Pump characterization: inludes data of the pump performance (flow rate) as a function of voltage input, channel depth, DEA spearation, and pre-indentation. This folder also includes the data of pump's blocked pressure as a fucntion of run-out flow rate under various input voltages. These data correspond to Figure 4.
### Pumping of various liquids: inludes data of flow rate measured when pumping liquids of various viscosities. These data correspond to Figure 5, Figure S10, and figure S11.
### Haptic actuator: inludes data of the demonstration of pump generating bi-directional flows to drive two haptic actuators. These data correspond to Figure 6.
### Finger actuator demo: inludes data of the demonstration of open- and closed control of a finger-sized actuator with the pump. This folder also includes the tracked angles from the recorded videos to compare with the designed tracktory. These data correspond to Figure 6 and Figure S12.
